[20:23:48]  The request for the question 'Please make a comprehensive summary that includes all the details.' was executed successfully. The result is: Zurich Airport is the largest international airport in Switzerland and serves as the principal hub for Swiss International Air Lines. It is located 13 kilometers north of central Zurich and serves much of the rest of the country through its surface transport links. The airport's history dates back to 1909 when mixed civil and military air traffic developed at Dubendorf airfield. In 1943, a study was commissioned to identify possible locations for the construction of a major airport, and in 1945, Switzerland's federal parliament decided that Zurich would be the site of a major airport. Construction of the airport began in 1946, and initial plans were centered on facilities capable of handling international airline traffic. The airport now has three runways with paved taxiways and is capable of handling a large volume of air traffic.

[20:24:10]  The request for the question 'Please make a comprehensive summary that includes all the details.' was executed successfully. The result is: Construction of Zurich Airport began in 1946 with the diversion of the Altbach stream. The first runway, West Runway 10/28, opened in 1948, followed by the blind runway 16/34. The airport lacked buildings, and a shanty town grew to the east of the reserved building site. In 1948, the development, construction, and operation of the buildings were outsourced to the Flughafen-Immobilien-Gesellschaft (FIG). The terminal building was designed in mid-1946 and completed in 1953. The construction costs exceeded expectations due to the removal of several meters of raised bog, the search for unexploded bombs, and an increase in the concrete area. In 1954, Locher & Cie was commissioned to design various project options for the second construction phase, which included runway extensions and the extension of public facilities. The expansion project failed in the cantonal referendum of 1957 due to concerns about aircraft noise. A redimensioned expansion project was approved in 1958, and construction work began without waiting for approval of federal funding. The first buildings were completed in 1960, and the airport underwent further expansion until the beginning of 1961. The paved area at the airport covered 1,013,000 m2 by the time work was completed.

[20:24:26]  The request for the question 'Please make a comprehensive summary that includes all the details.' was executed successfully. The result is: The extension of the terminal building at Zurich Airport was still in the design stage by the end of 1961, despite the completion of virtually all buildings in the second phase. The Federal Office of Civil Aviation had worked out a new project for a two-storey transverse hall, but the federal government demanded a considerable reduction in cost, leading to a dispute about the preferred design. The conflict was resolved in favor of the canton of Zurich and FIG's airport planners during a conference in December 1963. The extension was completed on April 1, 1971, with the opening of the last new hall wing. Noise mitigation measures were introduced in 1972, including a night-time curfew and new approach routes. The third stage of expansion was approved in 1970, with construction work beginning in 1971. The fourth construction phase was approved in 1980, and a new airport concept was published, focusing on qualitative expansion and environmental protection.

The result is: Zurich Airport underwent several expansion projects over the years, starting with the Building Programme 1981-1985, which included a finger dock, a new control tower, a baggage sorting system, and an operations center for aircraft crews.

In 2021, the main Terminal 1 is scheduled to be completely rebuilt to accommodate the expected growth in passenger numbers, which is projected to increase from 29 million to 50 million by 2030.

[20:25:31]  The request for the question 'Please make a comprehensive summary that includes all the details.' was executed successfully. The result is: The rescue service at Zurich Airport was established in 1982 to protect fire-fighting personnel during operations and provide medical care for injured passengers. As the need for rescue services for the population outside the airport grew, the service was separated from the fire service and became a separate division within the Safety&Security department. In 2007, the Rescue Service carried out around 5800 missions with 36 paramedics and three trainees, primarily in the region around the airport. The paramedics were equipped with extended skills that allowed the administration of medication according to algorithms, and an annual review of medication and algorithmic knowledge took place. In 2007, Unique (Flughafen Zürich AG) decided to outsource the rescue service, operations centre, and professional fire brigade to the Schutz und Rettung (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zürich for CHF 22 million. This resulted in massive internal restructuring, and since January 1, 2008, the base at the airport has been known as the "Wache Nord". The catchment area of the rescue service expanded to include the northern districts of Zürich Schwamendingen, Seebach, and Oerlikon.
